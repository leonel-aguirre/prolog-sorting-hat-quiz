### How to run the project

#### Clone this repo

To clone this repo and have it in your local environment you can use the `git clone` command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leonel-aguirre/prolog-sorting-hat-quiz.git
```

However, this will require you to first have installed [git]("https://git-scm.com/") in your environment. If you don't have it then you can just download the repo through the **Download ZIP** option in Github's web client.

#### Install NodeJS

This project was built using the [React library]("https://reactjs.org/"), which means it must be executed using [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/"), to do so, you must first download Node from the downloads section of its site and install it in your environment.

Node comes with the [npm package manager]("https://www.npmjs.com/") CLI, so after installing it you may run the following commands on your terminal and get the version of both CLI tools. If not, something might have gone wrong.

```sh
node --version
# v18.9.0 (Version might be different for you).
```

```sh
npm --version
# 8.19.1 (Version might be different for you).
```

#### Install Dependencies

By default the repo does not come with the dependencies of this project already installed, so, you will need to run the command in the root directory:

```sh
npm i
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder containing all the required dependencies.

---

#### Run the web app

Finally, simply execute the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

It will start a live web development server and open up a tab in your default browser pointing to it.

With the development server open you can modify the codebase and the server will update automatically.
