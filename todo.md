# TODO list for this project.

This file contains a list of the tasks that are expected to be completed in order to achieve the goal of the project.

### TODO List:

Tasks must be listed from highest to lowest priority, once a task is done it should be moved into the "completed tasks" list.

#### Knowledge base.

- [ ] 游리 Define facts for the four possible hogwarts houses. Example: `house(gryffindor), house(ravenclaw) ...`.
- [ ] 游리 Define the `normalize_weights` rule in the knowledge base for transforming a given weight (using its option identifier) into a value that is easier to handle and understand for the web app. Working implementation in javascript:

  ```js
  let weightsList = [
    [27.31307938, 25.92258493, -28.87112887, -22.21557617],
    [28.653864, -28.67894522, 26.97274135, -24.67312267],
    [-11.75519742, -10.92370078, -10.86606985, 35.83478687],
  ]

  // Should map the given set of weights to values between 0 and 1 for representing
  // percentages, if an input value is less or equal to 0 then the mapped value will
  // always be 0, otherwise it will become the division between itself by the sum of
  // all the set of input values, after that it will get rounded to the nearest integer
  // and finally get divided by 100. The resulting set of values should always sum up to 1.
  const normalizeWeights = (weights) => {
    return weights
      .map((value) => (value <= 0 ? 0 : value))
      .map((value, _, list) =>
        value > 0 ? value / list.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) : value
      )
      .map((value) => Math.round(value * 100) / 100)
  }

  /*
  let normalizedWeights = weightList.map(normalizeWeights)
  
  normalizeWeights -> [
  	[0.51,  0.49,  0,  0]
  	[0.52,  0,  0.48,  0]
  	[0,  0,  0,  1]
  ]
  */
  ```

- [ ] 游릭 Implement the procedure `random_question_id_from_category/2` which must retrieve a question id randomly from the given category. Example:

  ```pl
  random_question_id_from_category(c3, R).
  % R = q11.

  random_question_id_from_category(c3, R).
  % R = q8.

  random_question_id_from_category(c6, R).
  % R = q20.
  ```

- [ ] 游릭 Update `README.md` file with latest project information.

#### Web App.

- [ ] 游릭 Implement the quiz page UI with minimal functionality, at this point it is possible to retrieve data from the knowledge base and simulate the flow of going through the 8 questions of the quiz, using the category configuration list.

### Completed tasks:

- [x] Initialize git project.
- [x] Refactor the wording **"answer"** used along the knowledge base and use **"option"** instead. Example: `option(o1, "...")` instead of `answer(a1, "...")` and `question_options(q1, [o1, o2, o3, o4])` instead of `question_answers(q1, [a1, a2, a3, a4])`.
- [x] Collect the minimum information needed for the knowledge base (questions, options, weights) and the relations needed between them, add the corresponding facts into `knowledgeBase.pl` file.
  - [x] Add facts for the categories `question`, `option` and `weights`, `question` and `option` having unique identifiers and `weights` using the same identifier as their corresponding option.
  - [x] Add a set of `question_option` facts that relates each question id with its corresponding set of option ids in a list. Example: `question_option(q1, [o1, o2, o3, o4])`.
- [x] Initialize and config React app with bare minimum needs for it to work.
- [x] Test the **[Tau Prolog JavaScript Library](http://tau-prolog.org/)** and determine if it is the best tool for the project.
- [x] Define facts for categories and relate them with their corresponding questions. Example: `questions_category(c1, [q1, q2, q3])` or `question_category(c1, q1)` or any other approach that accomplishes the future goals.
- [x] Create a rule that builds up a list for the user's quiz session question categories configuration, it must contain numbers from 1 to 8 having the value 1 always at the first place and 8 at the last place, in between the remaining numbers (2 to 7), must be arranged randomly. Example: `[1, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 8]`, `[1, 7, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8]`.
- [x] Implement a strategy using `asserta`, `assertz` and `retract` (or any other approach) for managing and storing the results of a completed quiz. Example: when answering the quiz the user goes through multiple categories of questions (8 in total), a fact must take care of the progress of the user which must be updated during the process, something like `persistance_variable(currentCategoryIndex, 3)`, `persistance_variable(categoryConfigurationList, [1, 6, 5, 2, 7, 3, 4, 8])`, `persistance_variable(currentQuestionID, q21)` (any other approach that works should be fine).
- [x] Declare sass font style rules and expose them through the `_typography.scss` file. Include the **Open Sans** font into the App.
- [x] Add scss rules for breakpoints and expose them through the `_breakpoints.scss` file.
- [x] Add sass rules for spacing under the `_spacing.scss` file and expose them.
- [x] Implement the homepage of the site, at this point the app might need the integration of react router, the homepage should be accessible in the route `/`.

### Priority order:

The elements in the TODO list must be classified with the following symbols based on its priority:

- 游댮 High priority.
- 游리 Medium priority.
- 游릭 Low priority.
- 游뚾 Task definition is still work in progress.
